## R3. Containers

### R3.1 mj-wrapper

**In an email template** this is a node inside the root. **In a design-system module this
node IS the root** (R2.2): same tag, same attributes, same auto-layout, but created as a
COMPONENT with no `mainFrame` above it and none on it.

- Node: FRAME as a direct child of an email root; COMPONENT as a module root.
- Shared `name` = `mj-wrapper`.
- Auto-layout: `layoutMode = 'VERTICAL'`, vertical HUG (never FIXED), horizontal FILL under
  an email root or FIXED at the email width as a module root,
  `primaryAxisAlignItems = counterAxisAlignItems = 'MIN'`.
- Attribute mapping:

  | MJML attr | Figma property |
  | --- | --- |
  | `padding-top/right/bottom/left` | `paddingTop/Right/Bottom/Left` (parseFloat px) |
  | `background-color` | one SOLID fill; absent means `fills = []` |
  | `border-radius` | `cornerRadius` (or the four per-corner radii for a 4-value string) |
  | `full-width` | shared plugin data `fullWidth` = `'true'` (only if present) |

- Optional shared keys: `stackColumns` (`'true'` default), `reverseStack`. They propagate
  down to child sections that lack their own value.
- Children: `mj-section` frames in order; each gets `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` after
  append.

### R3.2 mj-section

- Node: FRAME, child of a wrapper.
- Shared `name` = `mj-section`.
- Auto-layout: `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'`, both sizing HUG, then FILL width as a child of
  the wrapper (height stays HUG),
  `primaryAxisAlignItems = counterAxisAlignItems = 'CENTER'` (primary exports as the section
  `text-align`: MIN left, MAX right, else center).
- Attribute mapping: same table as wrapper. Borders map to strokes (R5.6).
- Geometry matters: exported column widths are computed as
  `columnWidth / (section.width - section.paddingLeft - section.paddingRight) * 100%`. With
  the standard worker output (section 600 wide, padding-left/right 20, column width 560) that
  is exactly 100 percent. Set the section's horizontal padding from the library's content width
  rather than from the worker (R0.3.1: a 560 content width on a 600 body is 20/20), keep its
  vertical padding as the worker gave it, and make the column pixel widths sum to that content
  width. Where the worker's side margin and the library's disagree, the library wins and the column
  widths are re-derived to the new sum.
- Children: `mj-column` frames (or a single `mj-group`) left to right.
- Optional shared keys: `stackColumns` = `'false'` to prevent mobile stacking without a
  group; `reverseStack` = `'true'` to reverse stacking order on mobile.

### R3.3 mj-group

- Node: FRAME, MUST be a direct child of `mj-section`, never of a column.
- Shared `name` = `mj-group`.
- Auto-layout: `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'`, both sizing HUG (the group's width comes from the
  fixed columns inside it), `primaryAxisAlignItems = counterAxisAlignItems = 'CENTER'`
  (primary exports as horizontal alignment; counter exports as `vertical-align`).
- `background-color` to fill, `padding-*` to paddings, `border-radius` to radius, borders to
  strokes.
- Children: two or more `mj-column` frames with FIXED pixel widths.
- Width math: the exporter emits the group width as
  `group.width / (section.width - section horizontal padding) * 100%`, and each inner column
  as `column.width / (group.width - group horizontal padding) * 100%`. A 560 group containing
  280 + 280 exports 50%/50%. MJML requires percentage columns inside a group; you get that for
  free by setting exact pixel widths and letting the exporter divide.
- Columns inside a group keep their elements side by side on mobile.
- **A group is not the vehicle for the Two Column Swap** (R3.4.1, the standard rebuild for an
  overlapping or bleeding image). That pattern wants the mobile stacking a group suppresses, so
  it uses a plain `mj-section` holding two `mj-column`s. Reach for a group only when the design
  genuinely must stay side by side at 390px.

#### R3.3.1 Pinned widths that carry text need slack

**Never pin a text-bearing column at the width Figma hugged to.** Pinning the width is
correct, and R0.3 is right that the pixel IS the percentage. What the pixel is NOT is a safe
measurement. It was taken in the font Figma rendered on canvas, the email declares a different
one, and a pinned column cannot grow. Text that fit by a hair on canvas wraps at send time, in
a font the canvas never showed you.

Two independent sources of drift stack up:

1. **Same family name, different binary.** Figma renders its own bundled Inter. The exporter
   writes `font-family: Inter, Arial` and also emits an `mj-font` link to
   `fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter`, so the email renders Google's Inter build, not
   Figma's. Measured on a real string: "Lorem Ipsum Dolor" at Inter Regular 16px fits inside a
   143px content box on the Figma canvas and measures 143.39px in Chromium against Google's
   Inter. An overflow of 0.39px, 0.27 percent, is enough to wrap the row onto two lines.
2. **The webfont may not load at all.** Any client that blocks or fails the `mj-font` link
   falls back to the next entry in the stack, which is `fallBackFontName` and defaults to
   `Arial`. Measured drift on real strings against Figma's Inter runs as high as +11.5 percent,
   and it goes both ways: do not assume the fallback is always narrower or always wider than
   what you see.

So take the text node's natural hug width in Figma, then pin the column at:

```
column width = max( ceil(hugWidth * 1.12), hugWidth + 8 ) + the column's horizontal padding
```

The 12 percent covers the worst measured fallback drift **for Arial and Helvetica**, which is
what `fallBackFontName` resolves to unless someone changed it. The `+ 8px` floor stops short
strings ("Sale", "New", "Just In") from ending up with one or two pixels of slack, which is no
slack at all.

**Use 25 percent instead when the fallback is a wide face.** `fallBackFontName` is a writable
key, so a brand can set it to Verdana, Tahoma or Georgia. Those set much wider than Arial at the
same size: measured against Figma's rendering across realistic label strings, Verdana reached
+24.9 percent, Georgia +11.5 percent and Tahoma +9.8 percent, so a 12 percent allowance is not
enough to hold them. Read the root's `fallBackFontName` before you pin anything, and if it names
one of those three, widen by 1.25 rather than 1.12. A brand webfont paired with a wide fallback
is a materially different risk from Inter paired with Arial, and should not share one number.

Applying it: widen the FIXED columns only. Leave the group HUG and let Figma recompute its
width, and leave every FILL child alone, they cascade through the layout engine on their own.
Then re-derive the exported percentages by hand and confirm the inner ones still sum to 100.
Worked example from the fix that produced this rule: a 66px badge column plus a 151px label
column in a 217px group became 74 + 169 in a 243px group, exporting 30.4527% + 69.5473%, which
is exactly 100.

**Failure signature, so you recognize it next time:** it looks right on the Figma canvas and
wraps in the plugin Preview, same machine, same session, same minute. Nothing is mis-tagged, no
width is "wrong" in Figma terms, and a diff of the tree shows nothing at all. When a reviewer
reports a line breaking that does not break on canvas, suspect a pinned width first, and
measure the string against the **exported** font stack rather than trusting the canvas.

**Where else this bites.** Anywhere a FIXED width sits above text:

- Columns in a group (this section) and columns in a multi-column section (R0.3 case 2). Group
  columns are the worse of the two, because they never stack on mobile, so the pinched width is
  what every reader gets.
- An `mj-button` pinned to FIXED (R0.4) with a label inside it.

It does NOT apply to FILL columns or FILL buttons, which resolve against the content box at
render time and adapt. Do not pad those; the extra width would be real design drift for no gain.

#### R3.3.2 Group columns shrink on mobile, and R3.3.1 does not protect them

R3.3.1 protects a pinned column against font drift at the desktop width you pinned. It does not
protect the same column when an `mj-group` shrinks on a phone. A group never stacks, so every
fixed desktop column becomes a percentage at smaller viewports.

Before pinning any group column, compute its resolved phone width:

```
resolved = columnWidth / groupWidth * (mobileViewport - section horizontal padding at mobile)
```

At a 375px viewport with 20px padding on each side, the available width is 335px. A 137px column
inside a 560px group therefore resolves to `137 / 560 * 335 = 82px`.

Require, per column:

- **Text carrier:** `resolved >= widthOf(longest unbreakable word) * 1.05`. Measure the longest
  word, not the whole string, in the exported font.
- **Fixed-aspect image carrier:** `resolved >= image natural width`. Below that threshold the
  image is compressed and its aspect ratio breaks.

When a column fails, the group is the wrong container. Use one of these remedies:

1. Collapse the contents into one reflowing `mj-text` with `setRangeHyperlink` per linked range.
2. Drop the group so the columns stack.
3. Hide decorative content with `mobileStylesHideInMobileDevice`.

Widening is usually unavailable because group columns must still sum to the content box; taking
pixels from one neighbor can simply move the failure.

**Failure signature:** words break character by character only on mobile while the Figma canvas
and desktop preview look correct. The measured four-item navigation rendered as
`CHA / NGI / NG`, `G / E / A / R`, `CLO / THIN / G`, `GI / F / T / S` at 375px. Its 86px GEAR
column resolved to `86 / 560 * 335 = 51px`, too narrow for the word in the exported 17px font.
Rebuilding the row as one reflowing text node with four hyperlink ranges produced clean lines.

Run the same arithmetic on announcement bars and hero copy. A second measured case had a text
column resolving to 190px for copy whose natural hug width was 191px. One pixel of hidden deficit
would have wrapped poorly on every phone.

### R3.4 mj-column

- Node: FRAME, child of `mj-section` or `mj-group`.
- Shared `name` = `mj-column`.
- Auto-layout: `layoutMode = 'VERTICAL'`, vertical HUG, never FIXED. A column is the frame
  most often left at a fixed height by mistake, and it is where Outlook clipping bites
  hardest, because every leaf in the email hangs off a column.
- Horizontal sizing, per R0.3:
  - **Single column in its section: FILL.** It resolves to the section content box, which is
    the LIBRARY's content width once you have set the section's horizontal padding from it
    (R0.3.1), and exports `width: 100%`. Never HUG, which collapses the column to its content,
    and never FIXED, which exports the same 100 percent today and drifts silently the moment a
    padding changes (R0.3).
  - **Two or more columns in one section, or any column inside an `mj-group`: FIXED.** Load
    bearing: the exported percentage is derived from the pixel number. Start from the worker's
    `width` attrs for the RATIO between the columns, then re-derive the actual numbers so they
    sum to the library content width rather than to the worker's (R0.3.1 has the worked example).
    When you are deriving a number from a Figma measurement, and the column contains text, add
    slack per R3.3.1 before you pin it.
- **Axis alignment rule (the trap):** set BOTH axes to the dominant horizontal alignment of
  the column's content. `align="left"` or mixed: `MIN` / `MIN`. `align="center"`: `CENTER` /
  `CENTER`. `align="right"`: `MAX` / `MAX`. Why: `counterAxisAlignItems` drives the
  column-level `text-align: <value> !important` CSS, and `primaryAxisAlignItems` exports as
  the column `vertical-align`. For hug-height columns the vertical value is visually
  irrelevant, so horizontal fidelity wins; do not try to honor a worker `vertical-align: top`
  on a centered column.
  **Exception, multi-column rows:** when a section holds two or more columns whose content heights
  differ, set `primaryAxisAlignItems = 'MIN'` (exports vertical-align: top) while keeping
  `counterAxisAlignItems` on the content's horizontal alignment. The two properties are independent
  exporter reads, so this does not disturb text-align. Top is the default for multi-column rows;
  matched axes remain the rule for single-column sections.
- Attribute mapping:

  | MJML attr | Figma property |
  | --- | --- |
  | `width` | frame width in px: FILL for a lone column, FIXED at this number for multi-column and group columns |
  | `padding-*` | paddings |
  | `background-color` | SOLID fill; absent means `fills = []` (any fill at all exports as background-color, even at opacity 0) |
  | `border-radius` | cornerRadius |
  | `border` / `border-*` | strokes (R5.6) |

- Children: leaf PAIR wrapper frames and `mj-spacer`, top to bottom. After appending, set
  each child's `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'`.

#### R3.4.0 Multi-column gutters: a section with more than one column needs one

Every rule above lets a multi-column section sum to the library content width
with zero gutter between columns: three 186.67 columns in a 560 content box add
to 560, and no attribute mapping catches that adjacent cards touch. The
content-width equation passes trivially. The visual result is a section whose
headlines from adjacent columns visually concatenate into one sentence, whose
card images abut the next card's edge, and whose buttons sit a pixel from a
neighbour. That is a gutter failure, not a typography problem, and the
arithmetic gate cannot see it.

**A section with more than one column and zero horizontal column padding is a
FAIL unless the source design has a measured zero gutter and the batch report
says so.** Record the source gutter as a distinct measurement (the audit's
Spacing system census already carries it as a role), express it in the built
module as horizontal padding on the `mj-column` frames rather than as Figma
`itemSpacing`, an absolute position, or a visual gap.

Section R3.4.1 (Two Column Swap) restates the same rule as "spacing on one side
of each boundary only, never both" for the image-beside-text case. This section
generalises it to every multi-column row: each internal column boundary carries
the source's measured gutter, on ONE side of the boundary, expressed as column
padding.

Worked example, three equal cards in a 560 content box with a 16px source
gutter:

```
card content = (560 - 32) / 3 = 176px
column box   = 186.67px, with 8px horizontal padding on each side
adjacent boundary  = 8 + 8 = 16px between adjacent card content
```

Do not infer card width by dividing content width by column count unless the
measured source gutter is zero. That inference is how the failure lands: an
agent computes `560 / 3 = 186.67`, builds three 186.67 columns with zero
padding, and the columns sum correctly to the content width while the built
module has no breathing room.

The batch verification for this rule is in Phase 3 step 5 of
`module-conversion.md` under "Multi-column gutter present": list the horizontal padding on each
column, confirm at least one side of each internal boundary carries the source gutter, and reject
the module if not. Zero-padding multi-column layouts pass only with an explicit batch-report note
saying the source intentionally uses no gutter.

#### R3.4.1 THE TWO COLUMN SWAP: the standard rebuild for an overlapping or bleeding image

**The failure it replaces.** Source designs routinely place a photograph so it overlaps or
bleeds past the block it belongs to: a product shot entering from the right behind body copy, an
animal cropped off by the left edge of a cream band with text beside it. In Figma that is
z-order plus absolute position. Email has neither, so it cannot be reproduced, and no attribute
in this appendix gets close. **The standard remedy is to rebuild the block as a two column row:
one `mj-section`, two `mj-column`s, the image in one and the text in the other, in the same left
to right order the design implies.** The image stops at its column edge instead of bleeding, and
nothing overlaps. This is a settled decision rather than a per-module judgment call, so do not
re-argue it per module and do not go hunting for a cleverer reproduction of the overlap.

**How to recognize it, because nothing in the source labels it.** Two tells, either one of which
is enough:

- **The photo's bounds extend past the bounds of the block it reads as part of.** It is wider or
  taller than the band, or its absolute x/y put part of it outside the frame that appears to
  contain it. Compare the image node's absolute box against the band's box; do not judge it from
  the screenshot, where the overflow is invisible by construction.
- **The photo is clipped by a sibling drawn over it rather than by a mask.** A rectangle of
  background color sits above it in z-order and hides one edge. The layer panel shows no mask
  and no crop, and the composite you see exists in no single node.

On an unstructured source neither tell is written down anywhere, and the screenshot looks like an
ordinary photo in a band, which is why recognizing this is its own step rather than something you
notice in passing.

**The construction.** One `mj-section`, two `mj-column` children, image column and text column in
source order.

- Both columns FIXED (R0.3 case 2, R3.4), with their widths summing to the section content box: a
  600 wide section carrying 20/20 padding takes columns summing to 560. Unequal splits only
  survive because both numbers are pinned; the exporter derives the percentages from them.
- **Derive the widths in this order.** Pin the text column first, with the slack from R3.3.1,
  then give the image column the remainder, then size the image last. Worked: text hugs at 260
  and pins to 292, so the image column is 268.
- **The image is a rendered crop of the source region (R4.2.1), never the raw fill**, and it is
  cropped to its column rather than padded to fit, per R4.2.1's never-pad rule on aspect ratio.
  The `mj-image` rectangle is the image column's content width, and its height is the render's
  natural aspect at that width: continuing the example, a 780 x 660 render at 268 wide is 227
  tall, and 227 is the number.
- Heights HUG throughout (R0.1). Both alignment axes equal on the section and on each column
  (R3.4's axis alignment rule, the trap).
- Spacing on one side of each boundary only (R0.7). The gutter between the two columns is one
  column's horizontal padding, never both.
- **Not an `mj-group`.** A group exists to keep columns side by side on mobile (R3.3), which is
  the opposite of what this pattern wants.

**Mobile.** Two columns stack, so the image lands above the text, which is a normal email pattern
and arguably better than a bleed that would have had to be abandoned on a 390 wide screen anyway.
Stacking follows column order, and column order is the design's desktop order, not yours to choose:
when the design reads text then image on desktop but should read image then text on mobile, set
`reverseStack` = `'true'` on the section (R3.2) rather than reordering the columns.

**Why this is the default, so nobody relitigates it.** It keeps the text LIVE: the alternative,
flattening the whole block to one editable image, gives up selectable text, accessibility, and
dark mode for the sake of an effect. It degrades well, per the mobile note above. And the loss is
small and nameable, the overlap and nothing else, which is exactly what the concession field
records.

**What this does to the verdict.** A block whose only obstacle is an overlap or an edge bleed is
**verdict A**, carrying `A (concession: image bleed rebuilt as a two column row)`, and it is not
a C. Build it as live text like any other A, apply this substitute, and add nothing further. C
reads as a partial conversion, and this is not one.

**What stays verdict C.** Blocks that genuinely need splitting into live text plus an editable
image region: type set over a photographic collage where the lettering is part of the artwork, or
any treatment where copy and picture are one composited whole with no boundary to cut on. The
test: if you can name the rectangle the image belongs in and the rectangle the text belongs in,
it is this pattern and it is an A. If you cannot, it is a C.

### R3.5 mj-column-inner (rarely needed)

Use ONLY when a column needs a second, inner background or border box distinct from its own
(a card inside a colored column). Most card-in-column designs are expressible without it: put
the card fill, radius, and paddings directly on the `mj-column` and the outer color on the
section. Prefer that.

If you must use it: FRAME, the FIRST (and only) child of an `mj-column`, with the leaves moved
inside it. This is load bearing: the exporter checks `column.children[0]` and ONLY there. In
any other position its fill, radius, borders, and paddings are silently discarded and its
children flatten into the parent. If a card sits below other content in a column, split the
section so the card gets its own dedicated column with the `mj-column-inner` as sole first
child. Shared `name` = `mj-column-inner`; `layoutMode = 'VERTICAL'`, vertical HUG, horizontal
FILL, `primaryAxisAlignItems = counterAxisAlignItems = 'CENTER'`.

## R4. Leaf pairs

Every content leaf is TWO tagged nodes: an outer wrapper FRAME that carries layout (paddings,
alignment, container background) and an inner node that carries content. Style the inner
node, not the wrapper. Both must be tagged. A wrapper with a fill and no child exports as an
empty cell. Every pair wrapper hugs vertically.

### R4.1 mj-text: `mj-text-Frame` wrapping a TEXT node `mj-text`

Wrapper FRAME:
- Shared `name` = `mj-text-Frame`. Layer name `Text Block`.
- `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'` (yes, horizontal), vertical HUG, never FIXED: a pinned text
  frame is the classic Outlook clip, because copy length changes most often between sends.
  `primaryAxisAlignItems = counterAxisAlignItems = 'CENTER'`.
- `padding-*` from the mj-text attrs go HERE (the exporter reads `node.parent.paddingTop`).
- `fills = []` unless the MJML has `container-background-color`, which becomes this frame's
  SOLID fill.
- As a column child: `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'`.

Inner TEXT node (direct child):
- Shared `name` = `mj-text`.
- `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'`, `layoutSizingVertical = 'HUG'`.
- Property mapping:

  | MJML attr | TEXT property |
  | --- | --- |
  | `align` | `textAlignHorizontal` = LEFT / CENTER / RIGHT (the ONLY source of the exported `align`) |
  | `color` | one SOLID fill |
  | `font-family` | `fontName.family` (first of the stack) |
  | `font-weight` + `font-style` | `fontName.style` per the table in R1.9 |
  | `font-size` | `fontSize` (px number) |
  | `line-height` | `lineHeight` PERCENT (ratio * 100), AUTO allowed for 1.2/1 |
  | `letter-spacing` | `letterSpacing` `{ unit: 'PIXELS' }` |
  | `text-transform` | `textCase`: uppercase UPPER, lowercase LOWER, capitalize TITLE, none ORIGINAL |
  | `text-decoration` | `textDecoration`: underline UNDERLINE, line-through STRIKETHROUGH, none NONE |
  | `content` | `characters` after HTML conversion (R1.11); links via `setRangeHyperlink` |

- Also set `textAlignVertical = 'CENTER'`.

### R4.2 mj-image: `mj-image-Frame` wrapping a RECTANGLE `mj-image`

Wrapper FRAME:
- Shared `name` = `mj-image-Frame`. Layer name `Image Block`.
- `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'`, both sizing HUG (FILL width as column child, height stays
  HUG).
- `primaryAxisAlignItems` from `align`: left MIN, right MAX, center or absent CENTER. Set
  `counterAxisAlignItems` to the SAME value.
- `padding-*` from the mj-image attrs go HERE.
- `fills = []` ALWAYS.
- Never copy the rectangle's height onto this frame.

Inner RECTANGLE (direct child):
- Shared `name` = `mj-image`.
- `resize(width, height)` from the MJML `width`/`height` attrs. Keep
  `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FIXED'`. A RECTANGLE has no hug, and its pixel size is one of
  the four load-bearing FIXED widths.
- Fill: an IMAGE fill, `scaleMode: 'FILL'`, from an image that is already in the target file.
  `figma.createImageAsync(src)` is NOT available to you as an external agent, so a worker `src`
  URL is not something you can turn into a fill directly, and R4.2.1 has the route for anything
  coming from the customer's source file. The worker returns `"placeholder"` for every `src`
  anyway, so substitute the asset you round-tripped into the target file's foundations pages when
  one exists (logos especially); otherwise use one SOLID light gray fill (`#E8E8E8`). The
  exporter re-exports the node's own pixels, so a gray rect exports as a gray image, which is
  correct placeholder behavior.
- `cornerRadius` from `border-radius`.
- Shared plugin data ON THE RECTANGLE (not the wrapper): `href` from MJML `href` (omit when
  absent; never write `#`), `altText` from MJML `alt`.
- Sizing note: if the rectangle width is LESS than the column content width the exporter
  drops `fluid-on-mobile`; if equal it keeps it. So measure against the column content width you
  actually built, which is the library's (R0.3.1) rather than the side margin the worker returned:
  an image meant to fill its column takes that number and stays fluid, a 134 logo does not.

### R4.2.1 Bringing an image across from the source file: RENDER the node, never the raw fill

An image in a source file is almost never the whole photograph the designer started from. Two
things routinely sit between the raw bytes and what you see on the canvas, and neither one travels
with the raw asset:

- **A crop transform.** An image fill with `scaleMode: 'CROP'` carries an `imageTransform` matrix:
  which part of the photograph is showing, and at what zoom. Export the raw fill and you get the
  full frame back with that transform discarded, including everything the designer cropped away.
  The symptom is dead space where the composition used to be tight: a subject that filled 56 to 59
  percent of a band now occupies 27 percent and floats small inside it, or sits half out of view.
  Nothing about the rectangle's geometry is wrong, which is exactly why this gets misdiagnosed and
  reported as a spacing bug.
- **Clipping by overlapping siblings.** Unstructured sources clip by z-order and not by masks: a
  shape, a band of background, or another image sits on top and hides part of the picture. What you
  see is a composite of several nodes, and those pixels exist in none of them on its own. Only a
  render captures it. This is also the second tell for the Two Column Swap (R3.4.1): if the sibling
  drawn over the photo is what stops it bleeding past its block, the block needs rebuilding as a
  two column row and this rule supplies the image inside it.

So, for every image you bring across: **render the node as it appears and use the render.** Never
the raw fill, never the asset behind `fills[0].imageHash`. If the audit's row for a module says its
images are clipped by z-order rather than by masks, or that they carry a crop, that is this rule in
its `build constraints` column and it is not optional.

The route, since `figma.createImageAsync` is unavailable to an agent:

1. `download_assets` on the NODE in the source file (`get_screenshot` on the node, or
   `node.exportAsync`, do the same job), at 2x, to a local PNG. Reading `fills[0].imageHash` and
   fetching that asset instead is the mistake, not the shortcut.
2. **Open the PNG and look at it before uploading.** Three defects present as layout bugs rather
   than asset bugs:
   1. **Baked-in white.** A node with its own white background exports opaque and becomes a white
      box on a colored band. For line art, key white to transparency and set the color explicitly.
      For a photographic cutout, flood-fill the surround from the border to the real band color so
      white highlights inside the product survive.
   2. **The neighbour's content.** When cropping from a rendered parent, compare the far edge with
      the adjacent column's actual start, not the source node's declared width. A source node can
      be wider than its visible content. One measured crop carried 28px of the neighboring text and
      button edge while every Figma column measurement remained correct.
   3. **A fused row that is not missing.** Use the same visual inspection discipline required for
      any row captured as one composite: confirm the row is intentionally fused before treating
      the asset as complete.
   For a sliced icon set, composite each PNG onto its actual band color and inspect the result.
3. `upload_assets` to place that PNG onto the `mj-image` rectangle in the target file. The crop is
   baked into the pixels now, so the fill is a plain `scaleMode: 'FILL'` with an identity transform
   and there is no crop left to reproduce.
4. Verify against a screenshot of the SOURCE NODE, never against the source's raw asset.

**Aspect ratio: preserve the render's, never stretch to fit a chosen width.** Measure the ratio on
the rendered PNG and derive the height from the width you picked: `height = round(targetWidth *
renderH / renderW)`. A 995 x 550 render placed at 600 wide is 332 tall, and 332 is not a number to
round to something tidier. If a height was decided earlier and it disagrees with the render, the
render wins and you re-derive the height. Forcing a render into the wrong box is either a
`scaleMode: 'FILL'` quietly cropping it a second time or a visibly squashed photo.

**NEVER PAD AN ASSET TO FIT A CONTAINER, and never stretch one either.** An email image is declared
with a width and takes its height from the file, so the rectangle has exactly one correct height.
Adding white to the exported PNG to reach a ratio you already have bakes that padding into the
asset, where no later change to the rectangle can remove it. Both defects read as a spacing bug
rather than an image bug, which is what makes them expensive: the dead space looks like a padding
value nobody can find in the auto layout. **Size the container to the asset, never the asset to the
container.**

**Corollary for a design system: a height that has to vary cannot live on the component.** A module
meant to hold photographs of different shapes owns the WIDTH and leaves the height to the instance:
build the master at one representative photo's natural aspect and resize the `mj-image` rectangle
per instance. Two instances carrying different heights is correct here, and nothing in the export
cares. That resize runs straight into R0.8, so use the pattern there and read the rectangle's
dimensions back rather than trusting the call.

**Width is a decision, so make it deliberately and state it.** A source image narrower than its
canvas (995 in a 1089 wide design, so about 91 percent) is inset by design, not full bleed. Either
reproduce the inset as horizontal padding on the `mj-image-Frame`, at email scale and snapped to
the spacing scale the foundations already use, or take it full bleed at the body width. Both are
defensible. Pick against the design system's own established patterns, and record which you chose
and why in the batch report so the next module makes the same call. What this must never be is an
accident of arithmetic.

### R4.3 mj-button: `mj-button-Frame` wrapping FRAME `mj-button` whose DIRECT child is a TEXT node

Three levels. The TEXT node MUST be a direct child of the `mj-button` frame:
`extractButtonJson` locates it via `node.children.find(c => c.type === 'TEXT')`.

Level 1, wrapper FRAME:
- Shared `name` = `mj-button-Frame`. Layer name `Button Block`.
- `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'`, both sizing HUG (FILL width as column child).
- `primaryAxisAlignItems` from the mj-button `align` (left MIN, right MAX, else CENTER);
  `counterAxisAlignItems` the SAME value. The exporter reads the button's alignment from this
  frame, the button's direct parent. Mirror the same alignment on the containing column's
  axes when all of the column's content shares it; the two must not fight.
- `padding-*` from the mj-button attrs go HERE.
- `fills = []` unless `container-background-color` is set.

Level 2, FRAME `mj-button` (in a migration this is where the foundations button instance
sits, tagged `mj-button` itself):
- Shared `name` = `mj-button`. Layer name `Button`.
- `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'`, `layoutSizingVertical = 'HUG'` always, and
  `layoutSizingHorizontal` per R0.4 (HUG default, FILL for an edge to edge CTA, FIXED only
  when the design system pins a width). When you do pin one FIXED, give the label slack per
  R3.3.1: a pinned button cannot grow around a label that sets wider in the exported font than
  it did on the Figma canvas.
- `primaryAxisAlignItems` from `text-align` (default CENTER);
  `counterAxisAlignItems = 'CENTER'`.
- `background-color` to one SOLID fill (a missing fill exports
  `background-color: transparent`).
- `border-radius` to `cornerRadius`.
- `border` shorthand (e.g. `2px solid #1A1A4B`) to strokes: `strokes = [SOLID color]`,
  `strokeWeight = weight`. `border: 0px` means no strokes.
- `inner-padding` `"T R B L"` to paddings. Symmetric values are safe; the plugin's own
  re-import of asymmetric inner-padding swaps left/right, so avoid asymmetric inner padding.
  This padding is the button's tap target and the only thing that sets its height, so check
  the result is at least 44px tall rather than reaching for a fixed height.
- Shared plugin data ON THIS FRAME: `href` from MJML `href` (omit when absent).

Level 3, TEXT node (direct child of the `mj-button` frame):
- Shared `name` = `mj-button-text`. Layer name `Button Text`.
- `characters` = the button `content` (plain text, R1.11).
- Font family, style, size, line-height, text-transform, text-decoration mapped exactly as in
  R4.1.
- `color` attr to the TEXT fill (this exports as the button label color).
- `textAlignHorizontal = 'CENTER'`, `textAlignVertical = 'CENTER'`,
  `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'HUG'`, `layoutSizingVertical = 'HUG'`.

Do not add any other children. Button icon frames (`beforeIcon-Frame` / `afterIcon-Frame`)
are out of scope here, and they carry a naming trap: the library-save path finds them by a
raw layer-name substring check, so if you ever build them the literal substring must stay in
the layer name or the component loses its icons when it is saved.

### R4.4 mj-divider: `mj-divider-Frame` wrapping a LINE `mj-divider`

Wrapper FRAME:
- Shared `name` = `mj-divider-Frame`. Layer name `Divider`.
- `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'`, vertical HUG, FILL width as column child. Space above and
  below a rule is this frame's padding, never its height.
- `primaryAxisAlignItems` from `align` (default CENTER); `counterAxisAlignItems` the SAME
  value.
- `padding-*` from the mj-divider attrs go HERE. `fills = []` unless
  `container-background-color`.

Inner LINE node (use `figma.createLine()`, not a rectangle: the exporter reads `strokes`,
`strokeWeight`, and `dashPattern`):
- Shared `name` = `mj-divider`. Layer name `Divider Line`.
- `strokes = [SOLID <border-color>]` (default `#000000`); `strokeWeight` = numeric
  `border-width` (default 1); `dashPattern` `[]` solid, `[4, 4]` dashed, `[1, 2]` dotted.
- `resize(W, 0)` where W is the numeric `width` if given in px, else the column content
  width; then `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'` for a full-width divider.

### R4.5 mj-spacer: single FRAME (no pair), and the one fixed height in the spec

**Try not to need one** (R0.2). When you do build one: FRAME, direct child of the column,
shared `name` = `mj-spacer`, layer name `Spacer`, `layoutMode = 'HORIZONTAL'`, `fills = []`
(any visible fill exports as `container-background-color`), `resize(width, H)` with H from
the `height` attr, then `layoutSizingVertical = 'FIXED'` and
`layoutSizingHorizontal = 'FILL'`. `padding-*` attrs map to the frame's paddings. No
children.

## R5. Cross-cutting attribute rules

**R5.1 Padding.** Worker `padding-*` are explicit px strings; `parseFloat` them onto the
OWNING frame. Container tags carry their own paddings; leaf tags carry theirs on the PAIR
WRAPPER frame (the exporter reads `node.parent.padding*` for text, button, image, divider).
A gap the block above already pays for is not yours to pay for again: R0.7.

**R5.2 Colors.** All colors are hex strings. One SOLID fill per background; TEXT fills for
text color. `transparent` or absent means `fills = []`.

### R5.2.1 Measuring a type size off a screenshot

When the worker returns a size that conflicts with the audit's ramp, or two plausible sizes differ
by several pixels, measure ink height instead of guessing:

1. Crop tightly to one line in the source screenshot.
2. Threshold the crop to isolate the glyphs from the background.
3. Measure the pixel height of the ink as `measuredCapHeight`.
4. Find a known reference line from the audit's ramp in the same casing and measure its ink height
   as `knownCapHeight`; keep its text size as `knownSize`.
5. Solve:

   ```
   size = knownSize * (measuredCapHeight / knownCapHeight)
   ```

Compare all-caps with all-caps and mixed-case with mixed-case. Ascenders and descenders change the
cap-to-em ratio, so mixing casing shifts the result. Measured references from the batch 4
migration: an all-caps line at 28px measured 20px of ink, while a mixed-case line at 36px measured
33px.

Round the result onto the audit's ramp, never to the nearest round number. The purpose of the
measurement is to choose between approved ramp steps. If no step fits, return to the foundations
ramp-gap decision rather than inventing a per-module size.

**R5.3 Alignment master table.**

| Node | Property read by exporter | Exported as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mj-section` | `primaryAxisAlignItems` ('row' map) | section `text-align` |
| `mj-group` | `primaryAxisAlignItems`, `counterAxisAlignItems` | group left/right class, `vertical-align` |
| `mj-column` | `primaryAxisAlignItems` ('col' map: MIN top, MAX bottom, else middle) | column `vertical-align` |
| `mj-column` | `counterAxisAlignItems` ('col' map: MIN left, MAX right, else center) | column-level `text-align !important` CSS |
| TEXT `mj-text` | `textAlignHorizontal` | text `align` |
| `mj-image-Frame` | `primaryAxisAlignItems` ('row') | image `align` |
| `mj-button-Frame` | `primaryAxisAlignItems` ('row') | button `align` |
| `mj-button` | `primaryAxisAlignItems` ('row') | button `text-align` |
| `mj-divider-Frame` | `primaryAxisAlignItems` ('row') | divider `align` |

'row' map: MIN left, MAX right, anything else center. Always set the counter axis to the same
value as the primary on every one of these frames.

**R5.4 Column width handling.** Single column: a section 600 wide with `padding-left/right:
20px` and a FILL column (resolving to 560) exports `width: 100%`. Multi column: widths export
as percentages of the section content box. The worker may bake gutters as column paddings
(`padding-right: 10px` on the left column); keep those as paddings, do NOT convert them to
itemSpacing. Inside `mj-group`: same math against the group's content box. **The content box
itself is a library decision, not a per-module one:** the number a single column resolves to, and
the number a multi-column split sums to, is the one content width foundations settled for the whole
library, not the side margin the worker happened to return for this screenshot (R0.3.1). Reproduce
the worker's paddings everywhere else; this is the one padding you override, and full-bleed image
bands at the body width are its only exception.

**R5.5 href and alt.** Never in layer names or geometry; always shared plugin data. `href` on
the `mj-image` rectangle and on the `mj-button` frame; `altText` on the `mj-image` rectangle.
Omit the key entirely when the worker value is empty or `#`.

**R5.6 Borders.** Per-side `border-top/right/bottom/left` ("Wpx style #hex"): set
`strokes = [SOLID hex]` plus `strokeTopWeight` etc. per side (0 for absent sides). Uniform
`border` shorthand: `strokes` + `strokeWeight`. Dashed and dotted map to `dashPattern`
`[4,4]` / `[1,2]`.
